			<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
			<p class="section-subtitle">The short version</p>
			<div class="about__content">
				<div class="about__text">
					<p class="about__intro">I'm a serial founder and researcher who's obsessed with one question: <strong>when AI becomes the interface to all information, who gets credit?</strong></p>
					
					<p>At 19, I built <strong>Air Quake Simulations</strong>—a VR flight simulator hardware company. I 3D-printed cockpit components that undercut the industry by 10x. Sold it.</p>
					
					<p>Now I'm CTO of <strong>Wrodium</strong>, where my co-founder <strong>Leanid Palkhouski</strong> and I are building the picks-and-shovels for the AI search gold rush. We help brands become the sources AI engines trust, cite, and recommend—not just pages that exist somewhere on the internet.</p>
					
					<p>I study how this actually works. At <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>, I run research under <strong>Professor Marti Hearst</strong> on AI citation behavior—reverse-engineering how LLMs decide which sources to quote. That research became the <strong>GEO-16 framework</strong>: 16 predictive factors that determine whether AI cites you or your competitor.</p>
					
					<p>I'm not interested in "AI for AI's sake." I build systems that are auditable, explainable, and aligned with how real humans search, read, and decide. My background in digital humanities—race, gender, and bias in AI—isn't a side interest. It's why I build differently.</p>

					<p>Most "AI SEO" advice is vibes. I wanted data.</p>
					<p>So Leanid and I ran hundreds of experiments on how AI answer engines select sources. The result: <strong>"AI Answer Engine Citation Behavior: An Empirical Analysis of the GEO-16 Framework"</strong>—a research paper identifying the 16 factors that predict whether AI cites you.</p>

				<div class="value-card">
					<h3 class="value-card__title">Honest Attribution</h3>
					<p class="value-card__description">The web has a credit problem. People who create accurate, useful content get erased when AI summarizes them into a paragraph with no link. I want to fix that—better structure, better standards, better tracking for how AI systems cite sources.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="value-card">
					<h3 class="value-card__title">Responsibility that Ships</h3>
					<p class="value-card__description">I've spent years studying how AI systems erase or misrepresent people. That's not just an ethical concern—it's a product concern. If your AI visibility strategy gets you cited for the wrong thing, you've made your problem worse. I build systems that optimize for accurate exposure, not just exposure.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="value-card">
					<h3 class="value-card__title">Theory → Buttons</h3>
					<p class="value-card__description">I like research. But I like shipping more. The best part of Wrodium is turning abstract concepts like "generative engine optimization" into dashboards, workflows, and reports that marketers and founders actually use.</p>
