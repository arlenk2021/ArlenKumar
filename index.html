			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="about-text">
				<p>I am <strong>Arlen F. Kumar</strong>, a developer and co-founder of Wrodium, an AI content maintenance and generative engine optimization platform. At Wrodium, I work on the problem of how brands can become trusted, verifiable sources inside AI ecosystems, not just blue links in a search results page. Our tools translate human written content into AI readable, structured knowledge that systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity can reliably cite.</p>
				
				<p>My background is in statistics, probability, and machine learning. I have built models for handwritten digit recognition, language identification with RNNs, custom convolution and attention mechanisms, and more recently retrieval augmented systems that fact check content before it reaches users. Across these projects, I care as much about reliability and evaluation as I do about performance.</p>
				
				<p>I also write and think about how AI reshapes discovery, trust, and attribution. In the Wrodium Journal, I have authored pieces on AI search conversion and content maintenance, and co-authored a research paper on how AI answer engines cite sources under the GEO-16 framework.</p>
				
				<p>That work bridges my technical interests with a broader question: when AI is the interface to information, how do we make sure the right people and sources actually get credit.</p>
				
				<p>Before Wrodium, I spent a lot of time in digital humanities spaces, reading and writing about race, gender, and bias in AI, visualization ethics, and accessibility. That lens still shapes what I build today. I am less interested in "cool" AI for its own sake and more interested in systems that are auditable, explainable, and aligned with how real humans search, read, and decide.</p>

			<h2>Current Work</h2>
			<p class="wrodium-intro">I currently lead product and research at <strong>Wrodium</strong>, an AI content maintenance and GEO platform built for the AI search era. Wrodium helps brands keep their pages fresh, structured, and fact checked so that AI engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and others can understand, trust, and cite them.</p>
			
			<div class="wrodium-features">
				<h3>Concretely, Wrodium:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Audits how AI systems currently describe and reference your brand</li>
					<li>Maintains your content so it stays accurate, compliant, and AI readable</li>
					<li>Optimizes pages for generative engine optimization, not just traditional SEO</li>
					<li>Helps turn AI visibility into real revenue through better attribution and landing experiences</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<p class="wrodium-closing">My work spans backend architecture, GEO strategy, and experimentation with how AI answer engines actually behave in the wild. I care a lot about turning vague "AI exposure" into measurable, repeatable outcomes that marketers and founders can act on.</p>

			<h2>Research and Writing</h2>
			
			<div class="research-paper-image">
				<img src="research.png" alt="AI Answer Engine Citation Behavior: Bringing the GEO-16 Framework in B2B SaaS - Research paper by Arlen Kumar and Leanid Palkhouski">
			</div>
			
			<p class="research-intro">My work lives at the intersection of AI systems and content strategy. I co-authored <strong>"AI Answer Engine Citation Behavior: An Empirical Analysis of the GEO-16 Framework"</strong>, a research paper in the Wrodium Journal that studies how AI answer engines cite sources and how structured, well maintained content changes citation patterns.</p>
			
			<div class="research-articles">
				<p>Beyond that, I have written practitioner focused pieces on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How to turn ChatGPT visibility into measurable revenue through AI search conversion</li>
					<li>How to keep content maintained for AI assistants, not just search crawlers</li>
					<li>The practical differences between GEO, SEO, and AEO, and where modern tools fit into that stack</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<p>I treat these articles as part product work, part research notes. They are grounded in real data from B2B companies and ongoing experiments with how AI systems surface and attribute content.</p>

		<div class="values-content">
			<h2>What I Care About</h2>
			
			<div class="value-item">
				<h3>Honest Attribution</h3>
				<p>I want a web where the people who do the hard work of creating accurate content still get credit when AI becomes the interface. That means better tracking, better structure, and better standards for how AI systems cite sources.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="value-item">
				<h3>Responsibility at the Systems Level</h3>
				<p>Because of my background in digital humanities and work on race, gender, and bias in AI, I pay attention to who benefits from AI systems and who gets erased. That shows up in how I design experiments, how I think about evaluation, and how I talk about "impact."</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="value-item">
				<h3>Bridging Theory and Shipping</h3>
				<p>I like proof of concept ideas, but I care more about tools that people actually use. At Wrodium, my favorite work is turning abstract ideas like "GEO" or "AI citations" into buttons, dashboards, workflows, and reports that make sense to marketers, founders, and writers.</p>
